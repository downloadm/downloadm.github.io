/* A bug report for ACC.
Note that the count reported by ACC is different from that of AC++ and Movec.
Because ACC has bugs in the implementation of "after execution" pointcuts;
the code associated with each "after execution" pointcut is incorrectly
executed twice, instead of once, when an "around execution" pointcut also
exists for the same join point.
  See also bitcount/acc/spec_2_1.acc. */
